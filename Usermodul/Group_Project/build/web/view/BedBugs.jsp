                <p>Bedbugs have resurged worldwide and these blood-sucking insects (both the Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus) are a problem in many homes and hotels.1 Fortunately, bedbugs aren't known to spread contagious diseases. However, it is difficult to eradicate an infestation and you will want to take steps to prevent bringing bedbugs home. Learn how to identify and treat these pests.

                <h2>Bedbug Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Bedbug bites often appear as small, itchy, raised red areas on exposed skin, usually a few days after the actual bite.2﻿ However, some children and adults don't develop a reaction to the bites at all, even after repeated exposure. <br><br>
                    The bites appear much as other insect bites and can be seen in these patterns: <br><br>
                    A rash <br>
A line of bites <br>
A cluster of bites
                </h3>
                    <p>You can develop a skin infection if you scratch the bites. Rarely, a more severe allergic reaction to the bites could produce larger welts, blisters, or anaphylaxis. Bedbugs may also trigger asthma attacks and getting too many repeated bites could lead to anemia.3﻿ Anxiety, insomnia, and sleep disturbances are common due to the stress of discovering bedbugs.</p>
                   
                    <h3>Causes:</h3>
                    <p>Bedbugs are tiny flightless insects that feed only on blood.4﻿ They prefer humans but can feed on pets and farm animals. They feed at night and hide from light, especially in seams and crevices around the bed. <br>Usually, sleeping in a place where multiple people have slept increases your risk.5﻿ You might especially suspect bedbugs if you or your child: <br><br>
                        Traveled recently <br>
Slept on a used mattress or sat on a used piece of furniture <br>
Lives in an apartment building where bedbugs could have infested another apartment and have moved into yours <br>
Lives in or recently spent time in a college dorm room <br>
Are getting new unexplained bites each night <br>
Actually see bedbugs hiding in the seams or crevices of a mattress or box spring, along the edge of carpeting, behind picture frames, and hiding inside recesses of furniture    <br>               
                    <h3>Diagnosis                   </h3>
                    <p>A diagnosis of bedbugs is made by the appearance of the bites and finding bedbugs in your home environment. The bites are often not distinguishable from other insect bites, so it's important to inspect your bedroom for them closely if you have a skin reaction. <br>You can identify a bedbug infestation by checking bedding, mattress seams, furniture, and wall fixtures for the bugs or their traces.6﻿ Each mature bedbug is about the size of an apple seed, about 1/4 inch long. <br>You will often see their droppings instead, which are tiny brown or red specks. You may also see small blood stains on sheets or mattresses when a bedbug has been crushed after feeding.

                        Eggs about the same size as the adults might be seen in seams or cracks and you will also see their molted exoskeletons. There may also be a sweet musty odor from their pheromones. <br>                    </p>
                  
                    
                    <h3>Treatment                   </h3>
                    <p>The standard treatment for bacterial vaginosis is a short course of antibiotic drugs.7
                        Bradshaw CS, Sobel JD. Current treatment of bacterial vaginosis-limitations and need for innovation. J Infect Dis. 2016;214(Suppl 1):S14–S20. doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw159
                        
                         Antibiotics are a class of drugs that specifically treat bacterial infections. <br>The first-line options are Flagyl (metronidazole) and clindamycin. Both are highly effective in treating BV and have relatively mild side effects.
<br>Alternate treatments include a clindamycin vaginal suppository or Tindamax (tinidazole) tablets.8 Despite the effectiveness of these drugs, recurrence is common and may require multiple treatments to fully clear the infection.

Side effects include nausea, stomach ache, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and a metallic taste in the mouth. <br>In addition to antibiotics, several supportive remedies may help. These include probiotics (beneficial live bacteria found in yogurt and probiotic supplements) that may help prevent a recurrence. Boric acid (available as a capsule and vaginal suppository) is an old-time remedy attracting renewed medical interest. <br>
During treatment, wear looser pants or skirts to reduce vaginal moisture and heat that can promote bacterial growth. You can also reduce itching and swelling by applying a cool cloth to the vagina or splashing it with cold water.

                        <h3>Prevention                   </h3>
                    <p>Treating bedbugs includes caring for the bites and eliminating the infestation. The bites will heal naturally and nothing will speed that up. You can use over-the-counter products to relieve the itching but you may need a prescription if you develop a skin infection from scratching. Common treatments include:6

                        <br><br>Topical anti-itch and anti-inflammatory medications such as calamine lotion, Cortaid (cortisone) cream, and diphenhydramine cream
                        <br>Oral antihistamines, such as Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) or Atarax (hydroxyzine), a prescription strength antihistamine
<br> Topical antiseptic or antibiotic lotion for bacterial infection or oral antibiotics
