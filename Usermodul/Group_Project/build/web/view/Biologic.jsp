                <p>"Biologics" refer to any type of medical therapy that is derived from living organisms such as humans, animals, or microorganisms. This contrasts with traditional non-biologic pharmaceutical drugs, which are synthesized in a laboratory via chemical processes without using parts of living things. Other terms also sometimes used include “biologic therapy,” “biological therapy,” “biologicals,” and “biopharmaceuticals.” You might also hear them called by their over-the-counter names, or as a specific subcategory of biologic therapies (e.g., gene therapy). <br>The oldest forms of biologics have been around for many years, such as the vaccines developed in the 19th century. Insulin was another relatively early biologic therapy. However, since the 1990s, the number of biologics on the market has vastly multiplied. Many types of biological therapy are now available to treat a wide array of different medical conditions such as various forms of cancer and autoimmune diseases. More are developed and made available every year. These biologic therapies all come with different benefits and potential risks.1﻿

<h3>       How Do Biologics Work?     </h3>
                    <p>Different biologic therapies have different purposes, targets, and design, and they all work a little differently. Don’t hesitate to ask your healthcare provider if you have questions about the particular biologic therapy relevant to you. <br> <br>As an example, tocilizumab (trade name Actemra), a biologic used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, belongs to a class of biologic therapies called monoclonal antibodies. Technically, tocilizumab is a recombinant monoclonal IgG1 anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody. Unlike antibodies your body makes naturally, this type of antibody doesn’t fight infection. Instead, it can be used to directly target conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.3 <br><br>IL-6 is a cytokine (an immune-signaling molecule). It can bind cells and send signals. When IL-6 binds, it tends to increase inflammation and other processes that worsen rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab partly blocks the receptor for IL-6, which may decrease symptoms.

                        These particular monoclonal antibodies are produced through a series of steps, beginning with early production of antibodies in mice. Then scientists modify these antibodies, replacing much of them with portions of antibodies from humans. Inside the laboratory, many identical copies of these new antibodies are made. These hybrid antibodies can then be given to the patient to help block the body’s response to IL-6.</p>
                   
                    <h3>How are Biologic Therapies Different from Traditional Pharmaceutical Drugs?</h3>
                    <p>In general, the manufacturing process for biologics is more complicated than for small molecule drugs (“non-biologic” drug treatments, such as aspirin). This is part of why biologics are typically more expensive than non-biologic treatment alternatives. Because the manufacturing process is so complicated, the structure of biologics may not be fully understood. It may be difficult or impossible for another company to exactly replicate it. <br><br>On the whole, biologic therapies are more target-mediated than nonbiologic treatments. For example, methotrexate and sulfasalazine are two non-biologic drug treatments for rheumatoid arthritis. These drugs affect multiple different parts of a person’s immune system. By contrast, biologic therapies for rheumatoid arthritis have very specific targets (such as blocking a specific receptor for a targeted immune molecule). This decreases the likelihood of certain side effects, although others are still a potential risk.3﻿ </p>               
                    <h3>Conditions That Can Be Treated With Biologic Therapy</h3>
                    <p>More recently-developed biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of many different diseases. They have been especially important for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, cancer, and certain genetic conditions.1﻿ <br> <br>Rheumatoid arthritis

                        Crohn's disease <br>
                        Multiple sclerosis <br>

                    <h3>Biologics in Cancer Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Biologic therapies are also very important for cancer treatment, and many continue to be developed. There are many different types of these treatments. Sometimes they are used as a first-line treatment. Other times they are used after other treatments have failed, or in advanced cancers. Often, they are used in addition to other treatments. <br><br> Some of these treatments are therapeutic antibodies. For example, the drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is a biologically-designed antibody that is approved to treat many different types of solid tumors. It works by targeting a particular receptor found on certain immune cells. That allows the immune cells to more easily destroy cancer cells. These types of biologic therapies that stimulate the body’s immune system to better fight cancer are called immunotherapies.2

                        ﻿ <br><br>Other types of therapeutic antibodies interfere with signaling pathways that promote tumor growth, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin). Or they may trigger cancer cells to destroy themselves, like rituximab (Rituxan). In other cases, they may be linked to a toxic substance, which can help destroy the cancer cells. For example, the drug ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) works in this fashion. Other types of therapeutic antibodies also exist.

                        Immune cell therapy is another important area of biologic cancer therapy under development. This involves collecting some of an individual’s immune cells, modifying them in some way, and then reinjecting them. This makes the person’s immune cells better able to attack the tumor. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy and CAR-T cell therapy both fall in this category.2﻿
