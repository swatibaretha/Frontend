                    If you are concerned that you may have dementia, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider and start the diagnostic process as soon as possible. 
<br><br>
Though there is no single "dementia test," healthcare providers can use your medical history and a combination of tests to evaluate your symptoms and determine the cause.1
<br><br>
This article walks you through what it takes to diagnose dementia and out other possible causes for dementia-like symptoms. It also discusses how to cope with a diagnosis.

                <h2>Self/At-Home Testing
                </h2>
                <p>If you're worried about possible signs of dementia, you may want to keep a record of how often you notice these memory and thinking problems. You can even ask a family member or close friend how often they've noticed them.
<br><br>
                    There is also a cognitive assessment called the Self-Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) that is available online for people to use in the comfort of their own homes.2
        <br><br>            
                    You can take the test at home and see how you do, but be aware that the results should be brought to a healthcare provider for review.


                </p>

<h3>      Tests for Diagnosing Dementia</h3>
                    <p>There is no single test that can determine if someone has dementia. Instead, healthcare providers use a collection of tests, scans, and assessments to determine what is causing your symptoms.
<br><br>
                        The tests that your healthcare provider orders will depend on what other symptoms you're having, in addition to the changes in your cognitive abilities. Testing aims to learn more about what is causing your problems.
                    </p>
                   
                    <h2>Medical History
                    </h2>
                    <p>You should share with your practitioner any symptoms you're having, in addition to your memory and thought process difficulties. This includes things like changes in balance or walking, coordination, activity level, and overall health. Note how long you've had the symptoms and the impact they're having on your life.
                       <br><br> Also give your provider a complete list of the medications that you're taking. This includes any over-the-counter supplements or natural products you're taking, since they may interact with your prescriptions or with each other.</p>               
                    <h3>Blood Tests</h3>
                    <p>Your healthcare provider may order blood tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms. Some of the most common blood tests investigate: <br><br>
                        Infection <br>
Electrolyte levels <br>
Kidney function <br>
Liver function <br>
Thyroid function <br>
Vitamin B12 deficiency <br>
                    </p>
                  
                    
                    <h2>Types of Dementia
                    </h2>
                    <p>Sometimes, the diagnosis from the healthcare provider is labeled as a specific type of dementia, such as Alzheimer's, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, or frontotemporal dementia.5 This can help direct effective treatment and help you develop appropriate expectations for how the dementia may progress over time.
<br><br>
                        Sometimes a healthcare provider will simply diagnose you as having "dementia." This is because it can be difficult to determine which type is actually causing the symptoms. There are several kinds of dementia, and further testing may help clarify your specific type. <br><br>
                        In some cases, dementia symptoms may also be caused by more than one medical condition, such as the case of mixed dementia. Mixed dementia is diagnosed when it's suspected or known that two or more diseases are causing dementia, such as a combination of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.
