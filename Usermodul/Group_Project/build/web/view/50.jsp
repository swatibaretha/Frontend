                <h3>1. Be kind to your skin</h3>
                <p>Your skin is your body’s largest organTrusted Source. If you treat it with care, it can better protect your body from the elements, regulate your body temperature, and provide sensation. <br><br>

                    To keep it looking and functioning at its best:</p>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>Wear sunscreen and protective clothing when outside.</li>
                        <li>Get yearly <a href="">skin cancer</a> screenings.</li>
                        <li>Stick to gentle products in your anti-aging skin care routine.</li>
                        <li>Stay hydrated.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <h3>2. Exercise</h3>
                    
                        <p>Regular exercise significantly lowers your risk of diseases, such as <a href="">heart disease</a> and <a href="">cancer</a>, and helps you retain your mobility longer. Exercise also lowers stress and improves sleep, skin and bone health, and mood. <br><br>

                            The Department of Health & Human ServicesTrusted Source recommends that adults do:</p>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>2.5 to 5 hours per week of moderate-intensity exercise, 1.25 to 2.5 hours per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of the two</li>
                        <li>muscle strengthening activities of moderate intensity or greater, that involve all major muscle groups, two or more days per week</li>
                       
                    </ul>
                    <p>TSome examples of aerobic exercise include:</p>
                   
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>walking</li>
                        <li>Swimming</li>
                        <li>dancing</li>
                        <li>cycling</li>
                        <li>people who live on or close to a farm</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises can be performed using weights or resistance bands. <br><br>

                        Older adults should also focus on activities that include balance training in addition to aerobic and muscle strengthening exercises.</p>
                        <h3>3. Mind your diet</h3>
                        <p>Healthy foods are the way to go when it comes to aging gracefully. The Dietary Guidelines for AmericansTrusted Source recommends that you eat:</p>

                            <li>lean protein, such as fish and beans</li>
                            <li>at least three ounces of whole-grain cereals, breads, rice, or pasta every day</li>
                            <li>three servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy, such as milk, yogurt or cheese that are fortified with <a href="">vitamin D</a></vitamin></li>
                            <li>people who live on or close to a farm</li>
                            <li>Healthy fats</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Avoid using solid fats for cooking and use oils instead. Stay away from processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats. <br><br>

                            You should also keep your salt intake to a minimum to keep your blood pressure down.</p>

                        <p>Not taking care of your teeth not only ages your smile, but also puts you at risk for gum disease, which has been linked to heart disease, stroke, and bacterial pneumonia. <br><br>
