                <h2>Brain tumors</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, tumors form in the brain and can be very dangerous. These are called primary brain tumors. In other cases, cancer somewhere else in your body spreads to your brain. These are called secondary or metastatic brain tumors.<br> <br>

                    Brain tumors can be either malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). Doctors classify brain tumors as grades 1, 2, 3, or 4. Higher numbers indicate more aggressive tumors.<br> <br>
                    
                    The cause of brain tumors is largely unknown. They can occur in people of any age. Symptoms of brain tumors depend on the size and location of the tumor. The most common symptoms of brain tumors are:<br> <br>
                    Colicky pain in the abdomen region comes and goes. One moment, you may feel fine, but the next, you may experience sharp, sudden pain in your abdomen. Kidney stones and gallstones are often the cause of this type of pain.<br> <br></p>

                        <p>Neurodegenerative diseases cause your brain and nerves to deteriorate over time. They can change your personality and cause confusion. They can also destroy your brain’s tissue and nerves. <br><br>

                            Some brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, may develop as you age. They can slowly impair your memory and thought processes.

                        <p>Neurodegenerative diseases cause permanent damage, so symptoms tend to get worse as the disease progresses. New symptoms are also likely to develop over time. <br><br>

The goal of treatment for these conditions it to try to reduce your symptoms and help you maintain quality of life. Treatment often involves the use of medications to better manage your symptoms.<br><br></p>

                            Traumatic brain injury is most commonTrusted Source in children under 4 years old, young adults between ages 15 and 25 years, and older adults ages 65 years and older, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br><br>
                            
                            Brain tumors can affect people at any age. Your personal risk depends on your genetics and your exposure to environmental risk factors like radiation.<br><br>
                            
                            Older age and family history are the most significant risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases.<br><br>

                            They will likely perform a neurological exam to check your vision, hearing, and balance. They may also get images of your brain to help them make a diagnosis. The most common diagnostic imaging tools are <a href="">CT, MRI,</a> and <a href="">PET scans.</a> <br><br> 
                            
                            Your doctor might also need to study fluid from your brain and spinal cord. This helps them find bleeding in the brain, infection, and other abnormalities. <br><br>

                            Other disorders, like neurodegenerative diseases and some traumatic brain injuries, have no cure. People with these conditions may often face permanent changes in their behavior, mental abilities, or coordination.
