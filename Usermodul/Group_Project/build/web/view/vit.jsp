                            From helping you turn food into fuel to fortifying bones and eyesight, vitamins and minerals are the Beyoncé of the health world — they’re extremely capable, everything revolves around them, and they have powerful effects on their environment. <br><br>
                            
                            We see cartons of juice and boxes of cereal trumpeting their vitamin and mineral content, but what are these microscopic nutrients, really? What do they do? How do they work? And why are they so important?</p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bold">What are vitamins and minerals?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Vitamins and minerals are substances your body needs to develop and function normally. <br><br>

                        Every time you bike-commute to work, revel in a rainbow, or shake your booty on the dance floor, vitamins and minerals help you do it. <br><br>
                        
                        Vitamins are organic compounds, which basically means they are molecules made up of carbon and other elements.Trusted Source Heat, air, acid, or even light can cause them to break down. (Which is why storing vitamin supplements near the hot stove is a big no-no.) <br><br>
                        
                        It also makes getting enough vitamins from food harder because storing, cooking and even just exposing food to air can decrease its vitamin content.Trusted Source <br><br>
                        
                        Minerals come from rocks, soil, and water. Plants absorb these as they grow, and animals then steal those nutrients when they chomp on said plants. Om nom nom, indeed. <br><br>
                        
                        Minerals are inorganic single elements (meaning they do not contain carbon) and cannot be broken down. Score! This makes them pretty easy to absorb from food. <br><br>
                        
                        You get all 13 vitamins and both the major and trace minerals through the foods you eat. Your body can synthesize some by itself, like vitamin D after exposure to the sun. But most people can get all of the vitamins and minerals they need through a varied, balanced diet. <br><br>
                        
                        Taking a multivitamin can help fill in any gaps in your nutrition. However, it’s best to get them from the diet. <br><br>
                        
                        Vitamins and minerals are called micronutrients because you only need a very small amount of them compared to macronutrients (protein, carbs and fat). <br><br>
                        
                        But don’t be fooled by the “micro-” at the beginning of “micronutrients.” There’s nothing small about their impact on your body. <br><br>
                        
                        Consume or synthesize them. They’ll either bind to the fat from foods you eat and hang around in the body for later use (if they’re fat-soluble) or absorb straight into the cells (if they’re water-soluble). <br><br>
                        
                        And they’ll make damn sure everything ticks along smoothly. <br><br>
                        
                        Vitamins play many important roles in your body. <br><br>
                        
                        They help free the energy from the food you eat, making it possible for you to fuel yourself. They’re essential to building protein and help cells multiply. Which makes… erm, you. <br><br>
                        
                        They even help make collagen to strengthen your skin, build bones, fortify your vision, and combat harmful oxidative damage that might contribute to diseases and health conditions. <br><br>
                        
                        (Whew, vitamins are pretty busy.) <br><br>
                        
                        Minerals play many starring roles in your body. <br><br>
                        
                        They make it possible for your blood to carry oxygen throughout your body and help you achieve fluid balance. Minerals are key players in helping your muscles relax and contract. <br><br>
                        
                        They also support nerve transmission, help you maintain a steady heartbeat, and are even involved in making DNA. <br><br>
                        
                        In short, you just can’t live without them.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">The lingo</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Before we dive in and take a deeper look at each vitamin and mineral, let’s iron out some key terms we’ll be using (there’ll be some dreadful puns throughout, and no multivitamin will help you here).</p>
                     <ul>
                          <li><b>Vitamins.</b> These are organic substances required for normal cell function, growth, and development. There are 13 essential vitamins, which we’ll break down for you below.</li>
                          <li><b>Fat-soluble vitamins</b>. These are vitamins that bind to fat in the food you eat. The body then stores them for later use. They include vitamins A, D, E, and K.</li>
                          <li><b>Water-soluble vitamins.</b> The rest of the vitamins — vitamin C, and the B complex vitamins — are water-soluble, meaning cells can absorb them directly.</li>
                          <li><b>Minerals.</b> Minerals are inorganic substances, and all hold a place on the good ol’ periodic table. They’re also necessary for healthy body functions and development. There are two groups of minerals: macrominerals (of which the body needs at least 100 milligrams every day)Trusted Source and trace minerals (only a pinch required — but without them, you run the risk of serious deficiencies).</li>
                          <li><b>RDA.</b> Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) represent the average daily dietary intake of each vitamin and mineral a person needs to stay healthy and steer clear of deficiencies. The values, which are all backed by scientific data, are broken down by age and gender.</li>
                          <li><b>AI. </b>Those vitamins for which the science bods haven’t established an RDA (usually due to lack of scientific data) have an adequate intake (AI) in place.</li>
                          <li><b>UL.</b> The tolerable upper intake level (UL) is the maximum amount of daily vitamin or mineral dosage that is likely to be safe for the average person. Stay under the UL when using supplements to avoid toxicity.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p style="font-size: 18px;">The vitamins or minerals that we need in larger doses are expressed in units of milligrams (mg). Trace minerals and vitamins appear in micrograms (mcg). There are 1,000 mcg in one milligram (no fancy math here). <br><br>

                        All of Greatist’s recommendations for daily intake (“What you need”) and limits (“What’s too much?”) follow the RDA, AI, and UL guidelines.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">(Plus choline, which isn’t technically a vitamin but usually sneaks into the list.) <br><br>

                        Get these in you every day to stay on top of your health.</p>
            

                    <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Biotin (aka vitamin B7 or vitamin H)</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Like the rest of the water-soluble B-complex vitamins, biotin plays a huge role in cell growth and food metabolism.Trusted Source. <br><br>

                        Metabolism is the process by which our bodies convert the food we eat into energy and powers everything we do, from thinking, to running, to Hula-Hooping (definitely Hula-Hooping).<br><br>

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">While not technically a vitamin, the essential nutrient choline often hangs out with the B-vitamins because of its similarities. <br><br>

                        Choline is a building block of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine,Trusted Source which is super important for the nerve and brain activities that control memory and muscle movement.<br><br>
                        
                        Choline also helps turn the food we eat and our stored energy (hello, love handles) into fuel.<br><br>
                        
                        Vegetarians, vegans, those who are pregnant, and endurance athletes are at greater risk for choline deficiency. Not getting enough choline is linked to fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, neurological disorders, and impaired fetal development.<br><br>

                            Taking more than 1,000 mcg before becoming pregnant may be associated with lower scores on tests of cognitive development in children between the ages of 4 to 5 years.<br><br>

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> On the lookout for beautiful skin, hair, and red blood cells? Niacin is here to help. Ooh, yeah, bring on those luscious RBCs. Like other water-soluble B vitamins, niacin is essential for converting food into energy. <br><br>

                        It’s also central to the health of skin, hair, eyes, liver, and the nervous system,Trusted Source and may lower risks of high cholesterol and heart disease.<br><br>
                        
                        Extreme deficiencies in niacin, though rare, may lead to pellagra, which is associated with the “the four D’s”: dermatitis (skin irritation), diarrhea, dementia, and death (yikes!).<br><br>
                        
                        So yeah. Niacin does a f*ckton of important stuff in your body.<br><br>

                            Vitamin A deficiency also plays a role in diarrhea and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases in developing countries.<br><br>

                                        K is for “koagulation,” the German word for coagulation, or clotting (klotting?).

                                        Though this trace mineral might well enhance insulin activity and the breakdown of dietary sugars, we only need it in small amounts. It’s not “essential” in the same way as some other minerals.<br><br>
                                        
                                        While some chromium supplements tout muscle building and weight loss benefits, there’s little solid research evidence that backs up the claims.<br><br>

                                        While it’s essential for fluid balance, nerve signal transmission, muscle contractions, digestion, and blood pressure, it’s possible to have too much of this savory mineral set.<br><br>
                                        
                                        Since the average daily diet already includes salt waaaay in excess, consider low salt alternatives like olive oil (instead of butter), unsalted nuts in favor of salted ones, and fresh fruit.<br><br>

However, most of us get way more sodium than we need and are at higher risk of getting too much than not enough.<br><br>

                                        The sodium content of a food varies wildly based on how much salt is used to prepare it. However, the question for salt shouldn’t be how to get it — you should focus on how to eat less of it. <br><br>
                                        
                                        Some brands of frozen pizza contain 370 mg per slice, while others contain a whopping 730 mg. Even whole fruits and vegetables contain natural sodium. For example, raw spinach contains 24 mg per cup.<br><br>
