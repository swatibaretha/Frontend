                <p>Women have been enjoying the benefits of the birth control pill since the first one was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 9, 1960. When used as directed, the pill is 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.1

                    Most women can safely use birth control pills. However, as with all medications, they do have possible side effects and risks.
                    
                    Here's a rundown of the pros and cons of using oral contraceptives, including common side effects.

                <h2>Pros of the Birth Control Pill</h2>
                <p>
                    Obviously, the main reasons to take the birth control pill are to prevent pregnancy and regulate the menstrual cycle. Some of the pill's benefits include: <br><br>
                    It is a very convenient and safe method of contraception. <br>
It allows for sexual spontaneity (so you don't have to plan in advance).br
It can lead to lighter periods.2 <br>
It can decrease the discomfort of menstrual cramps. <br>
Combination pills can be taken to change the timing and frequency of your period or to skip your period altogether.
                </p>

<h3>       Other Benefits  </h3>
                    <p>Combination birth control pills that include both estrogen and progestin can also provide other health benefits. They may offer some protection against:3 <br><br>
                        Ovarian cancer <br>
                        Endometrial cancer <br>
                        Uterine fibroids <br>
                        Symptoms of endometriosis <br>
                        Heavy menstrual bleeding <br>
                        Polycystic ovary syndrome <br>
                        Acne <br>
                        Migraines</p>
                   
                    <h2>Cons of the Birth Control Pill</h2>
                    <p>If you use birth control pills, you may experience some side effects. The good news is that most of these side effects will go away by the second or third month of use as your body adjusts to the hormones in the pill. <br><br>
                        Headaches <br>
                        Breast tenderness <br>
                        Nausea (sometimes with vomiting) <br>
                        Bleeding between periods</p>               
                    <h3>Managing Side Effects</h3>
                    <p>You should read the paper insert that comes inside your pill pack for more detailed information about how to use them and what the side effects are. The insert should also explain when to take your birth control pills and what to do if you miss a pill.

                        You can take your birth control pill with an evening meal or at bedtime to help decrease nausea and/or vomiting.
                        
                        Side effects are a common reason why people stop taking birth control pills. Talk to your healthcare provider to see if changing to a different brand of pill may help, especially if the side effects last longer than a few months.5</p>
                  
                    
                    <h3>Biologics in Cancer Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Biologic therapies are also very important for cancer treatment, and many continue to be developed. There are many different types of these treatments. Sometimes they are used as a first-line treatment. Other times they are used after other treatments have failed, or in advanced cancers. Often, they are used in addition to other treatments. <br><br> Some of these treatments are therapeutic antibodies. For example, the drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is a biologically-designed antibody that is approved to treat many different types of solid tumors. It works by targeting a particular receptor found on certain immune cells. That allows the immune cells to more easily destroy cancer cells. These types of biologic therapies that stimulate the body’s immune system to better fight cancer are called immunotherapies.2
                        National Cancer Institute. Biological Therapies for Cancer.
                        
                        ﻿ <br><br>Other types of therapeutic antibodies interfere with signaling pathways that promote tumor growth, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin). Or they may trigger cancer cells to destroy themselves, like rituximab (Rituxan). In other cases, they may be linked to a toxic substance, which can help destroy the cancer cells. For example, the drug ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) works in this fashion. Other types of therapeutic antibodies also exist.

                        Immune cell therapy is another important area of biologic cancer therapy under development. This involves collecting some of an individual’s immune cells, modifying them in some way, and then reinjecting them. This makes the person’s immune cells better able to attack the tumor. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy and CAR-T cell therapy both fall in this category.2﻿
