                <p>Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of fungus. Vaginal yeast infections are typically caused by a type called Candida albicans. This yeast is commonly found in the mucous membranes lining the genitals but typically only causes problems when the healthy balance of microorganisms in the membranes is disrupted, causing too much yeast to grow. <br><br>

                    The overgrowth of yeast causes inflammation, which can lead to uncomfortable symptoms such as itching, burning, or abnormal discharge. Vaginal yeast infections are the most common type, but yeast infections can occur in other places, such as the mouth and penis.
                     <br><br>
                    This article will discuss the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of yeast infections.</p>

                <h2>What Causes a Vaginal Yeast Infection?</h2>
                <p>A vaginal yeast infection is caused by an overgrowth of yeast (usually Candida albicans) in and around the <a href="">vagina</a> or <a href="">vulva</a>. Changes to the balance of microorganisms in the genital mucous membranes prompt overgrowth.</p>
                    
                    <p>Factors that can lead to imbalance and overgrowth include:</p>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>A weakened immune system</li>
                        <li>Pregnancy</li>
                        <li>Certain medications (such as antibiotics, steroids, hormone therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy)</li>

                        <li>Sweating (yeast thrives in warm, humid conditions)</li>
                        <li>Synthetic and tight clothes that don't allow the skin to "breathe"</li>
                        <li>Washing genitals with soap</li>

                    <h3>Non-Vaginal Types of Yeast Infections</h3>
                    <p>Yeast infections can happen in other areas of the body, including:</p>

                        <li><a href="">Nail beds</a>: Pain, swelling, pus, white or yellow nail that separates from the nail bed</li>
                        <li><b>Nipples</b>: Called thrush; usually happens while breastfeeding; sore, flaky, shiny, itchy, deep pink, blistered, and/or cracked nipples, achy breast, shooting pain in the breast during or after feedings</li>

                    <h2>Yeast Infection Symptoms</h2>
                        <p>Vaginal yeast infections can cause symptoms such as:</p>

                        <p>To diagnose a yeast infection, your healthcare provider may: </p>

                            <li>Give you a physical exam, that may include looking inside the vagina</li>
                            <li>Take a sample of vaginal discharge, scrape off a bit of skin, or remove part of a nail, depending on the location of the infection, <a href="">to examine it for yeast</a></li>
                            <li>Order more tests if there are repeated or severe infections to look for a cause, such as a weakened immune system</li>
                            <li>Test sexual partner(s) if yeast infections are recurrent</li>
                        </ul>
                            <h2>Test sexual partner(s) if yeast infections are recurrent</h2>
                            <p>Vaginal yeast infections can usually be treated at home with over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medications. These come in the form of medicated creams or suppositories, placed in the vagina with an applicator.4

                                The duration of treatment varies, but it usually takes one to six days. Follow all the directions for the product, and use all of the recommended medication, even if your symptoms have improved. <br><br>

                                <h3>Can a Yeast Infection Go Away Without Treatment?</h3>
                                <p>Mild vaginal yeast infections can clear up on their own, but it's common for symptoms to get worse without treatment.7 Yeast infections in other areas of the body often require treatment to go away.</p>
                            <h2>Medical Treatment for Yeast Infections</h2>
                            <p>Depending on the location and severity of the yeast infection, prescription treatment may be necessary. <br><br>

                                Oral medication, such as Diflucan (fluconazole), may be prescribed by a healthcare provider.

                                <h2>Risks of Untreated Yeast Infections </h2>
                                <p>
                                    Vaginal yeast infections rarely cause <a href="">serious complications</a>. Having a weakened immune system, such as during cancer treatment or having a condition like HIV, can make complications more likely. <br><br>

                                    Scratching the vagina or vulva can spread inflammation to nearby tissues, such as the <a href="">urethra</a> opening (where the urine exits when you urinate). It can also make the area vulnerable to infection from other germs. <br><br>

                                    Vaginal infections <a href="">during pregnancy</a> may somewhat increase risks such as premature labor, miscarriage, or premature birth. Yeast infections could also be passed from parent to baby during birth, which could lead to diaper rash or a yeast infection in the <a href="">baby's mouth</a>.
                                </p>
                                <h2>When to Call a Healthcare Provider for a Yeast Infection</h2>
                            <p>Signs and symptoms of yeast infections can be similar to other, more serious infections.

                                <h2>How Long Does It Take to Heal From a Yeast Infection?</h2>
                                <p>Typically, medication is taken for one to seven days. Follow the directions that come with the product you use or your healthcare provider's instructions. In some cases, longer treatment may be needed if directed by your healthcare provider.

                                    With medication, symptoms typically improve in a few days, but it can take about a week to cure the infection.
