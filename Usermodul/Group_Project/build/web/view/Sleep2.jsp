                <h2>OverView</h2>
                <p>Depression is a <a href="">common cause of fatigue</a>, so you might be wondering whether your fatigue is a result of depression. But just because you're tired all the time doesn't necessarily mean that you're depressed. <br><br>

                    The fact is there are many underlying conditions that could be responsible for <a href="">feeling tired all the time</a>. From <a href="">mood disorders</a> to issues affecting your physical health like chronic fatigue syndrome, the following psychiatric and medical conditions are some of the most common ailments associated with fatigue. <br><br>
                    
                    But first, it's important to note that many of these conditions share symptoms similar to depression, so we'll start there. By understanding the distinctions between depression and other factors that cause fatigue, you can seek out the right treatment and start to feel like your energetic self again.

                <h2>Psychiatric Factors</h2>
                <h3>Depression</h3>
                <p>Depression, which research suggests is associated with an imbalance of <a href="">neurotransmitters</a> in the brain, is commonly linked with fatigue. <br><br>
                     The condition is also associated with <a href="">disturbed sleep</a>, which can also significantly contribute to tiredness. While some people may have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, others may oversleep. Both of these sleep disturbances can leave you feeling apathetic and sluggish. <br><br>
                    
                    Other symptoms associated with depression include:</p>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>Appetite and/or weight changes</li>
                        <li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions</li>
                        <li>Fatigue or loss of energy</li>
                        <li>Feelings of guilt or worthlessness</li>
                        <li>Lack of interest in activities normally enjoyed</li>
                        <li>Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood</li>
                        <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
                    </ul>
                <div id="vid">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEqlQvczMJQ?si=YBTL01uTZ72M3pqs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>If you think you may be experiencing depression, talk to your doctor. They can refer you to a <a href="">therapist</a> who can help you manage your emotions or another mental health professional such as a <a href="">psychiatrist</a> who may also recommend <a href="">antidepressants</a>. Don't let depression go untreated.</p>
                <h3>Anxiety</h3>
                <p>Anxiety and anxiety disorders are often associated with fatigue as well as sleep disturbances. Sleep deprivation may also contribute to feelings of anxiety, which perpetuates a cycle of both anxiety and sleeplessness. This, of course, can make it difficult to manage both conditions. <br><br>

                    The following are common anxiety disorders that may be associated with sleep disruptions and fatigue:</p>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li><a href="">Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</a>: Fatigue is a common symptom of GAD, which is characterized by excessive worry about a number of events and activities accompanied by a variety of physical and emotional symptoms.</li>
                        <li><a href="">Social anxiety disorder (SAD)</a>: People with SAD have excessive fear about certain social situations that might expose them to possible scrutiny.</li>
                        <li><a href="">Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</a>: A person's internal obsessions and compulsive behaviors can be draining and impact sleep. OCD and depression are often comorbid conditions.</li>
                        <li><a href="">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</a>: Flashbacks and nightmares are commonly associated with PTSD,4 which can develop following a traumatic event and lead to debilitating levels of anxiety. The increased arousal and anxiety as well as the sleep disturbances that are part of PTSD can leave one feeling depleted and tired.</li>
                        <li><a href="">Panic disorder</a>: The excessive worry associated with panic disorder can cause insomnia and fatigue. Those with panic disorders may also experience nocturnal panic attacks.
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="">Specific phobias</a>: Those with specific phobias have an intense, usually irrational fear associated with a particular trigger.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Stress</h3>
                    <p>Stress can lead to sleepless nights. Stress can also wear you down and cause you to feel fatigued. We've all experienced the repercussions of stress at one time or another. If left unmanaged, stress can also wreak havoc on your mood. Stress can be a trigger for depression and anxiety disorders. <br><br>

                        Like anxiety, stress can contribute to poor sleep and poor sleep can <a href="">create stress</a>. For instance, you know that you need to get a good night's sleep so that you have energy the next day, but you might have trouble falling asleep because you are worried that you aren't going to get enough sleep. <br><br>
                        
                        Fortunately, there are many ways to combat stress that don't require sleep aids or medications. mind-body techniques such as <a href="">yoga nidra</a>, or "yogic sleep," and <a href="">meditation</a> can help you manage stress and sleep better so you can wake up feeling refreshed with more energy.</p>
                        <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
                        <p><a href="">Bipolar disorder</a> is characterized by extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity. Insomnia, nightmares, and erratic sleep-wake cycles are common among people with bipolar disorder, contributing to fatigue and general tiredness.</p>
                        <h3>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</h3>
                        <p><a href="">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a> is a common psychiatric condition among both children and adults and is commonly associated with a variety of sleep disturbances that can contribute to daytime sleepiness. Many of the medications used to treat ADHD can also impact sleep.

                            Sleep patterns and habits are usually assessed when treating ADHD. In fact, research has shown that interventions to improve sleep hygiene can help reduce the severity of ADHD symptoms and increase the person's overall quality of life.</p>
                <h2>Physical Health Factors</h2>
                <p>Often, physical health issues such as thyroid problems and chronic fatigue syndrome can result in fatigue symptoms resembling depression.
                    
                     It's also possible that fibromyalgia, sleep apnea, or an autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus could cause you to feel tired all the time. <br><br>
                    
                    Here are some physical factors that could be draining your energy and what you can do about it.</p>
                        <h3>Underactive Thyroid</h3>
                        <p>If you have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) simple activities can leave you feeling wiped out. Your thyroid is a small gland in the front of your neck that produces hormones that regulate your metabolism. When it's not producing enough of these hormones, your metabolism slows down. This can lead to fatigue, weight gain, and even depression. <br><br>

                            The traditional treatment for hypothyroidism involves medications that increase thyroid levels in your body. Symptoms of fatigue may get better or go away once the thyroid condition has been treated appropriately with medication. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will use blood tests to look at your levels of thyroid hormones including thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).</p>
                
                
                <h2>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h2>
                <p>Chronic fatigue syndrome, now known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), is a condition characterized by a reduction in the ability to engage in activities, along with profound fatigue. This is often accompanied by unrefreshing sleep, cognitive issues, and changes in blood pressure and pulse.
                    <br><br>
                    Those with chronic fatigue still have an interest in activities but lack the energy and capacity to do them. Because CFS shares symptoms with other medical and psychiatric illnesses, it is not uncommon for it to be diagnosed as depression or another psychiatric condition. People may also experience both CFS and a psychiatric condition at the same time.
                </p>
                   
                    <h3>Fibromyalgia</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fibromyalgia seems to overlap with chronic fatigue, but people with this disorder also have chronic pain all over their bodies The disorder is usually diagnosed by tender points in certain muscles that respond with pain when touched a certain way. Sleep disturbance is also common in chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. Research is ongoing into the causes of fibromyalgia. <br><br>
                        There is no specific test that can diagnose fibromyalgia. Instead, doctors must rely on an assessment of your health history and symptoms. Diagnosis typically requires the presence of widespread chronic pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Treatment for fibromyalgia usually involves a combination of medication and lifestyle changes.
                    </p>
                        <h3>Autoimmune Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Autoimmune disorders involve the immune system attacking the body. Rheumatoid arthritis, <a href="">lupus</a>, and <a href="">celiac disease</a> are examples of autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune processes have also been implicated in certain types of diabetes and multiple sclerosis (MS). <br><br>

                            While these conditions aren't as common as depression, they can present with similar symptoms. In fact, according to some research, depression-like symptoms are present in up to 50% of patients with autoimmune disorders.17 These symptoms typically emerge over the course of the disease and are associated with psychosocial factors, <a href="">chronic pain</a>, and long periods of disability. <br><br>
                            
                            Dealing with an autoimmune disorder can also increase your risk of developing depression. Results of one large study showed that a prior hospital contact because of an autoimmune disease increased the subsequent risk of mood disorder diagnosis by 45%.</p>
                            <h3>Sleep Apnea</h3>
                            <p>Sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, can also cause many symptoms similar to those of depression. Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition where your breathing is interrupted during sleep for longer than 10 seconds. This can happen many times an hour. <br><br>

                                These frequent interruptions interfere with your sleep quality, resulting in daytime fatigue, morning headaches, and poor concentration. It can also have a serious impact on your mood. One study found that approximately 46% of people with sleep apnea have symptoms of depression.</p>
                                <h3>Iron-Deficiency Anemia</h3>
                                <p>Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, the part of the red blood cell that carries oxygen to all the parts of your body. <br><br>

                                    When you don't have enough iron, your blood can't carry enough oxygen to your body. This can leave you feeling sluggish, fatigued, and lightheaded. You may also have dull or pale skin and experience headaches, dizziness, and shortness of breath. </p>
                                <h3>Dehydration and Inadequate Nutrition</h3>
                                <p>Staying hydrated and getting proper nutrition is important for keeping your energy levels up. Research shows that a lack of fluid intake is associated with sleep issues, fatigue, and alertness. <br><br>

                                    Not getting enough calories in your diet can also leave you feeling tired all the time, as can eating too many refined carbohydrates24 or not getting enough protein.
                                    
                                     Allergies to foods such as wheat or dairy may also contribute to tiredness.</p>
                                     <h3>Lifestyle Factors</h3>
                                     <p>If you don't seem to have enough energy, it could be because you're not getting enough physical activity. Research shows a sedentary lifestyle can lead to fatigue and difficulty sleeping. <br><br>

                                        Cigarettes and alcohol can also affect sleep quality and leave you feeling groggy the next day.</p>
                        <h2>Tips for More Energy</h2>
                        <p>Depending on the severity of your symptoms and whether you've been diagnosed with a psychiatric or medical condition, there are a few habits anyone can do to improve their quality of sleep and have more energy the next day.</p>
                   
                    <ul id="list">
                       <li><b>Exercise regularly</b>. There's plenty of evidence to show that regular exercise is good for your <a href="">mental and physical health</a>. You'll have more energy and sleep better, too.</li>
                       <li><b>Take short naps</b>. Tired as you may be, <a href="">sleeping too much</a> during the day can affect your ability to fall or stay asleep at night. Taking <a href="">short, 20- to 30-minute naps</a> can give you a quick burst of rest without hindering your ability to fall asleep at bedtime.</li>
                       <li><b>Establish a bedtime routine</b>. Prepare for slumber each night with rituals to help you unwind. Take a hot shower or bath, read a paperback book, or meditate to calm your body and mind. Follow your bedtime routine each night to set the stage for a solid night’s sleep. Be sure to make your bedroom as dark as possible, too.</li>
                       <li><b>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and other stimulants before bed</b>. Drinking coffee, soda, or other caffeinated beverages in the late afternoon or evening can make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep, as can drinking alcohol. If you smoke cigarettes, <a href="">consider quitting</a>.</li>
                       <li><b>Power down your devices</b>. Leave the screens in another room. Scrolling before bedtime can make it more difficult for your mind to wind down and prepare for sleep. The light your device produces can also negatively impact your sleep. Make the bedroom a no-phone zone, if possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                   <h2>Sanjeevani</h2>
                    <p>While depression remains one of the most common causes of symptoms like tiredness and fatigue, it's not the only condition that produces depression-like symptoms. If you are experiencing persistent tiredness and fatigue, it is important to seek a proper diagnosis. It's also possible to have more than one diagnosis (known as <a href="">comorbidity</a>) contributing to your symptoms. <br><br>

                        For example, there are people who have both clinical depression and hypothyroidism. If you're tired all the time and low on energy, your best bet is to work with your healthcare provider to explore your symptoms and get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>
