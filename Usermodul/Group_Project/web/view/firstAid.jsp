                        <p>First aid is the immediate care a sick or injured person gets. In some cases, it may be the only care a person needs. In others, first aid is a way to prevent a person's condition from worsening and keep them alive until paramedics arrive or they are taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>The best way to prepare for these events is to get official first-aid training. In the meantime, there are some basic life-saving steps you can learn.</p>

<p>This article goes over the first aid steps to follow in 10 different situations and how to tell if more care is needed.</p>

                    <h2>ABCs of First Aid</h2>

<p>If someone is unconscious or unresponsive, the basic principle of first aid that you need to know is ABC: airway, breathing, and circulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Airway:</strong> If someone’s not breathing, the first thing you need to do is clear their airway.</li>
  <li><strong>Breathing:</strong> If you have cleared a person’s airway but they’re still not breathing, provide rescue breathing.</li>
  <li><strong>Circulation:</strong> As you are doing rescue breathing, perform chest compressions to keep the person’s blood circulating. If the person is breathing but is not responsive, check their pulse. If their heart has stopped, provide chest compressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever possible, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before providing first aid. Use hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available. This will help keep you from passing bacteria on to the person you are assisting.</p>

<p>A simpler version of the ABCs is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Awake?</strong> If the person is not awake, try to wake them. If they don’t wake up, make sure someone is calling 911 and move on to the next step.</li>
  <li><strong>Breathing?</strong> If a person is not awake and not breathing, start rescue breathing and chest compressions. Then, move to the next step.</li>
  <li><strong>Continue care:</strong> When you call for help, follow instructions from 911 or continue treatment until an ambulance arrives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some first aid courses also include D and E:</p>

<p><strong>D</strong> can stand for: Disability assessment, deadly bleeding, or automated external defibrillator (AED). An AED is a device that shocks the heart to make it start beating again.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> can stand for: Examination (checking the person for signs of injury, bleeding, allergies, or other problems once you know they’re breathing and their heart is beating).</p>

<h2>First Aid for a Stopped Heart </h2>
<img src="images/StopH.webp" alt="">
<p>CPR is one of the most important emergency medical procedures that a person can know. If a person’s heart is not beating, they could die. When a person is in cardiac arrest, doing CPR and/or using an AED could save their life.</p>

<p>AEDs are available in many public areas and businesses. These first aid devices are made to be easy to use even if you have no training.</p>



<p><strong>What to Do</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a person nearby. Make eye contact, point to them, and say: “Call 911.”</li>
  <li>Start doing chest compressions on the person who needs help. Using both your hands, push down hard and fast in the center of the person’s chest. Let their chest come back up naturally between compressions. You may hear pops or snaps; this is normal.</li>
  <li>Keep going until someone with more training arrives.</li>
  <li>If you’re trained in CPR, you can use chest compressions and rescue breathing.</li>
  <li>If it’s available, use an AED. However, do not put off doing chest compressions to go look for an AED. If possible, instruct someone else to go find the device and bring it to you.</li>
</ol>

            



<h2>First Aid for Bleeding </h2>
<img src="images/StopB.webp" alt="">
<p>If someone is injured and bleeding, there are a few basics about how blood works that will be helpful for you to know. The color of the blood and how it’s leaving the body can give you a sense of the extent of the injury:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Capillaries:</strong> Bleeding from the smallest blood vessels (capillaries) looks like a trickle. This kind of bleeding usually stops on its own.</li>
  <li><strong>Veins:</strong> A consistent blood flow and blood that’s a dark red color is most likely coming from the veins. This type of bleeding can range from mild to severe.</li>
  <li><strong>Arteries:</strong> Arteries are the largest blood vessels and carry a lot of oxygen. If they are injured, bright red blood will spurt out. Blood can be lost very fast with this kind of bleeding.</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost all bleeding can be controlled with first aid. If severe bleeding keeps going, a person can go into shock and may die.</p>

<h2>First Aid for Puncture Wounds</h2>

<p><strong>What to Do</strong></p>

<p>While it is important to stop bleeding, begin with the ABCs of first aid.</p>

<p>The next steps are to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wash your hands or put on disposable gloves if you have them. This will protect you from infectious diseases like viral hepatitis and HIV/AIDS that can be spread in a person’s blood.</li>
  <li>Rinse the wound with water.</li>
  <li>Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth (e.g., towel, blanket, clothing).</li>
  <li>Apply direct pressure to stop the flow of blood and encourage clotting (when blood naturally thickens to stop blood loss).</li>
  <li>Elevate the bleeding body part above the person’s head if you can.</li>
  <li>Do not remove the cloth if it becomes soaked. Removing the first layer will interfere with the clotting process and result in more blood loss. Instead, add more layers if needed.</li>
  <li>Once bleeding has stopped, put a clean bandage on the wound.</li>
</ol>

<p>Get medical help if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The wound is deep.</li>
  <li>The wound has widely separated sides.</li>
  <li>The injury oozes blood after pressure has been applied.</li>
  <li>The injury is from an animal or human bite.</li>
  <li>The injury is a puncture, burn, or electrical injury.</li>
  <li>You think there is arterial bleeding.</li>
  <li>Blood is soaking through the bandages.</li>
  <li>The bleeding is not stopping.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are taking the person to the hospital, make sure that you have someone else who can keep administering first aid while you drive.</p>

<h2>First Aid for Choking</h2>
<p>Choking happens when a person’s windpipe (trachea) gets blocked by food or an object. It is a serious event that can lead to unconsciousness or even death.</p>

<p>Signs of choking include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gagging, gasping, or wheezing</li>
  <li>Inability to talk or make noise</li>
  <li>Turning blue in the face</li>
  <li>Grabbing at the throat</li>
  <li>Waving arms</li>
  <li>Looking panicked</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/StopC.webp" alt="">
<p><strong>Using the Heimlich Maneuver</strong></p>

<p>The Heimlich maneuver is a series of abdominal thrusts that can help dislodge the thing a person is choking on. This first aid technique should only be done if someone is truly choking.</p>

<p>Before doing anything, ask the person if they are choking. Remember: If someone is coughing or talking, they are not choking.</p>

<p><strong>What Is the Recovery Position?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What to Do</strong></p>

<p>If someone is choking, you should know how to use the Heimlich maneuver.</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stand behind the person and lean them slightly forward.</li>
  <li>Put your arms around their waist.</li>
  <li>Clench your fist and place it between their belly button (navel) and rib cage.</li>
  <li>Grab your fist with your other hand.</li>
  <li>Pull your clenched fist sharply backward and upward under the person’s rib cage in five quick thrusts.</li>
  <li>Repeat until the object is coughed up.</li>
</ol>

<p>For someone who is obese or pregnant, perform the thrusts around the chest instead of the abdomen.</p>

<p>If someone is choking and becomes unconscious:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Place them on their back and kneel over them.</li>
  <li>Place the heel of your hand slightly above their belly button.</li>
  <li>Place your other hand on top of it.</li>
  <li>Give quick upward thrusts to dislodge the object.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Helping a Choking Infant</strong></p>

<p>If a baby is choking, you need to use different first aid techniques to help them.</p>

<p><strong>Start with back blows:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Lay the baby across your forearm, face down.</li>
  <li>Support them with your lap or upper thigh.</li>
  <li>Hold their chest in your hand and jaw between your fingers (the baby’s head should be pointed down so it’s lower than their body).</li>
  <li>With the heel of your free hand, give five quick, forceful blows to the baby’s back between the shoulder blades.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If back blows don’t work, try chest thrusts:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Turn the baby face up, keeping them on your lap for support.</li>
  <li>Keeping their head angled down, lower than their body, hold the back of their head with your hand to steady it.</li>
  <li>Place two or three of your fingers in the center of the baby’s chest just below the nipples.</li>
  <li>Give five quick thrusts downward so the breastbone gets pushed in about 1.5 inches.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a choking infant loses consciousness, you may need to do CPR until emergency help arrives.</p>

<p><strong>How to Help a Choking Infant</strong></p>

<p><strong>What to Do if You're Alone and Choking</strong></p>

<p>You can give yourself the Heimlich maneuver even if you are alone.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Call 911 first, even though you will not be able to speak. Leave the phone connected. 911 can pinpoint your location and send emergency help. Use a landline if available. If a landline isn't available, a cell phone can be used.</li>
  <li>Grasp one fist with the other hand and place above your belly button.</li>
  <li>Thrust inward and upward with your fist. Repeat until the object is dislodged.</li>
  <li>You can also bend over a hard surface such as the back of a chair. Use the hard surface to apply repeated thrusts to your abdomen. Repeat until the object is dislodged.</li>
</ol>

                    <h2>First Aid for Burns</h2>

                    <p>The first step to treating a burn is to stop the burning process. This might mean:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                      <li>Cleaning up chemicals</li>
                      <li>Turning off electricity</li>
                      <li>Cooling heat with running water</li>
                      <li>Covering up or taking a person inside out of the sun</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The severity of a burn is based on how deep in the skin it is and how big it is:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>First-degree burn:</strong> This kind of burn only affects the outer layer of skin and causes redness and swelling. It is considered a minor burn.</li>
                      <li><strong>Second-degree burn:</strong> This kind of burn affects two layers of skin and causes blistering, redness, and swelling. It is considered a major burn if it’s more than 3 inches wide or is on the face, hands, feet, genitals, buttocks, or over a major joint.</li>
                      <li><strong>Third-degree burn:</strong> This kind of burn affects deeper layers of skin and causes white or blackened skin that can be numb. It is always considered a major burn.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>What to Do</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Major burns need emergency medical attention. Once you’ve stopped the burning process, call 911 or get someone else to.</p>
                    
                    <p>For burns that are not an emergency, you can take these first aid steps:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                      <li>Flush the burned area with cool running water for several minutes. Do not use ice.</li>
                      <li>Apply a light gauze bandage. If the burn is minor, you can put on an ointment, like aloe vera, before you cover it.</li>
                      <li>Take Motrin (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain relief if you need it.</li>
                      <li>Do not break any blisters that form.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>The Different Degrees of Burns</h2>
                    
                    <h2>First Aid for Blisters</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong>What to Do</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>If the blister is small, not open, and doesn’t hurt, it’s best to leave it alone. You can cover it to prevent rubbing, which could cause it to swell and burst.</p>
                    
                    <p>Do not pop a small blister. This could let bacteria get inside it and cause an infection.</p>
                    
                    <p>If the blister is big or painful, you need to take different steps to treat it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here are the first-aid steps to take for a more serious blister:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                      <li>Wash your hands.</li>
                      <li>Sterilize a needle with alcohol.</li>
                      <li>Make small holes at the edge of the blister.</li>
                      <li>Gently push out the fluid.</li>
                      <li>Apply antibiotic ointment.</li>
                      <li>Put on a bandage.</li>
                      <li>If possible, take steps to protect the area from further rubbing or pressure.</li>

                    <p><strong>What to Do If You Spill Bleach on Your Skin</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>If you have a compromised immune system, you are more likely to get an infection and should not drain a blister on your own. However, your healthcare provider may want to drain it to help prevent infection.</p>
                    
                    <p>If a blister breaks open on its own:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                      <li>Gently wash the area with clean water only.</li>
                      <li>Smooth the flap of broken skin over the newly exposed skin, unless it’s dirty, torn, or there is pus under it.</li>
                      <li>Put petroleum jelly on it.</li>
                      <li>Cover it with a bandage.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Change the bandage any time it gets wet. Take it off when you go to bed to give the area a chance to air out.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness that causes pain in the body's muscles, skin, and joints. Researchers believe that the nervous systems of people with fibromyalgia are overly sensitive to pain.</p>

<p>The FDA has approved three medications to treat fibromyalgia pain. Exercise helps patients loosen their muscles and joints and maintain flexibility. Other lifestyle choices such as reducing stress and getting enough sleep can also help FMS patients manage pain.</p>

<p>It can be hard to live with fibromyalgia, especially since painful attacks can be unpredictable. Finding the right treatments may take time and experimentation. With dedication, many people with FMS do find relief.</p>
