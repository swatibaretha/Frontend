                <p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but frustrating condition in which the balance of bacteria in the vagina gets out of sync. Usually, the body is able to maintain the ideal balance. But if the balance is disrupted, certain types of bacteria can overgrow and cause symptoms. <br>BV is readily treated and usually doesn't cause any other health problems. With that said, it can increase the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or lead to birth complications in people who are pregnant.</p>

                <h2>Bacterial Vaginosis Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Of the 21 million women in the United States believed to have bacterial vaginosis each year, only around three million actually have symptoms.1

                    When they occur, the symptoms of BV tend to be mild but persistent and may include:</h3>
                    <p>A grayish-white or yellow vaginal discharge <br>
                        <br>A "fishy" smell that can get worse after intercourse
                        <br>A burning sensation when urinating
                        <br>Vaginal itchiness, redness, and swelling
                        <br>Vaginal bleeding after intercourse</p>
                   
                    <h3>Causes:</h3>
                    <p>Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the level of "good" bacteria in the vagina suddenly drops. This allows "bad" bacteria to grow excessively. The main "good" bacteria, called lactobacillus, makes the vagina slightly acidic so that "bad" bacteria can't overgrow. <br>Sex can instigate BV by introducing new or excessive amounts of bacteria into the vagina.
                        <br><br>Some of the more common causes of BV include:3 <br><br>Condomless sex
                        <br>Multiple sex partners
                        <br>New sex partners
                        <br>Shared sex toys
                        <br>Douching
                        <br>Bubble baths
                        <br>Vaginal deodorants
                        <br>Smoking
                        <br>Intrauterine devices (IUDs)                   
                    <h3>Diagnosis                   </h3>
                    <p>Since bacterial vaginosis is not caused by a single agent, the diagnosis is largely based on a review of your medical history and symptoms along with various lab tests and procedures.
<br>The microscopic exam would look for "clue cells" (meaning vaginal cells studded with bacteria). Agram stain would also be used to differentiate "good" bacteria from "bad" ones, allowing the lab to check for imbalances in the vaginal flora.6

                    <h3>Treatment                   </h3>
                    <p>The standard treatment for bacterial vaginosis is a short course of antibiotic drugs.7
                        Bradshaw CS, Sobel JD. Current treatment of bacterial vaginosis-limitations and need for innovation. J Infect Dis. 2016;214(Suppl 1):S14–S20. doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw159
                        
                         Antibiotics are a class of drugs that specifically treat bacterial infections. <br>The first-line options are Flagyl (metronidazole) and clindamycin. Both are highly effective in treating BV and have relatively mild side effects.
<br>Alternate treatments include a clindamycin vaginal suppository or Tindamax (tinidazole) tablets.8 Despite the effectiveness of these drugs, recurrence is common and may require multiple treatments to fully clear the infection.

Side effects include nausea, stomach ache, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and a metallic taste in the mouth. <br>In addition to antibiotics, several supportive remedies may help. These include probiotics (beneficial live bacteria found in yogurt and probiotic supplements) that may help prevent a recurrence. Boric acid (available as a capsule and vaginal suppository) is an old-time remedy attracting renewed medical interest. <br>
During treatment, wear looser pants or skirts to reduce vaginal moisture and heat that can promote bacterial growth. You can also reduce itching and swelling by applying a cool cloth to the vagina or splashing it with cold water.

                        <h3>Prevention                   </h3>
                    <p>As common as bacterial vaginosis is, there are things you can do to reduce your risk. These include safer sex practices and practicing good vaginal hygiene. <br> <br>To prevent bacterial vaginosis: <br><br>Limit the number of sex partners.
                       <br> Use condoms correctly and consistently.
                        <br> Do not douche.
                        <br> Avoid bubble baths and vaginal deodorants.
                        <br> Wipe from front to back after urinating.
                        <br> Avoid IUDs if you have recurrent BV or have had severe BV in the past.
                        </p>
