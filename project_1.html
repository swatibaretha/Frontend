        <h1>Symptoms of a Headache </h1>
        <h4>By Swati baretha, MD Updated on October 29, 2021 <br> Medically reviewed by Huma Sheikh, MD</h4>
      <div class="container1">
            <p>The most prominent symptom of headaches is head pain,<br> which can range from mild to severe. But headache symptoms <br> can go beyond head pain. For some people, other symptoms—like <br> nausea, vision changes, or sensitivity to light—add to the <br>discomfort and distress of a headache.  Primary headaches occur on <br> their own, without an underlying cause. Headaches that result from <br> an underlying medical condition are called secondary headaches. <br>1 Carbaat PAT. Headache: classification and diagnosis. <br> 2016;123(11):539-544. doi. 10.5177/ntvt.2016.11.16122. Published November, <br> 2016.   This article describes the common symptoms of primary and secondary headaches.</p>

        <h1>Frequent Symptoms</h1><br>
        <p>Primary headaches are more common than secondary headaches, and they tend to recur. The most common types of primary headaches are tension headaches, sinus headaches, and migraines. Secondary headaches, which are less common,<br> can be indicators of an underlying condition, such as a brain tumor or meningitis (infection around the brain).</p>
        <p>While there are some differences in the symptoms of different headache types, it is always best to get medical attention,<br> especially if your headaches are new, severe, or accompanied by other symptoms.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Tension Headaches </h4> <br>
        <p>Tension headaches are common. They often occur due to factors such as lack of sleep, stress, muscle tension, looking at screens for too long, They can also occur without a specific cause. Some people have frequent muscle tension headaches, but many people only experience them once in a while</p>
        <br>
        <ul><li type="squre">Mild to moderate head pain, usually described as dull</li>
           <li> Pain around the forehead, usually on both sides of the head</li>
            <li>A sense of muscle tightness in the forehead, jaw, neck, shoulders, or a combination of these</li></ul>
            <br><h1>Sinus Headaches</h1><br>
            <p>Sinus headaches are fairly common. They can occur when you have a cold, allergies, or any other reason that causes congestion. They tend to be mild to moderate in severity, and they can begin suddenly and resolve as soon as the sinus congestion is relieved.</p>

            </ul>
        <br>
        <h1>Migraine</h1> <br>
        <p>Migraines are more common in females than males, although they can affect males. They often occur in a pattern that corresponds to the menstrual cycle, and they can be triggered by lack of sleep, alcohol, skipping meals, stress, certain odors, medications, and certain foods.
            <br><br>
            Common symptoms of migraines:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>

                                                <li> Food cravings</li>
                   

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Aura symptoms can include vision loss, seeing various shapes or bright spots or flashes of light, experiencing pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg, weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body, and difficulty speaking.</p>
            <p><h1>Cluster Headache</h1><br><br>
                A cluster headache is a rare type of headache. It is more common among adults males, and it can occur in clusters—for days or weeks on end, without symptoms in between the clusters.
                <br><br>
                Common symptoms of cluster headaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Severe pain around one eye, with redness and tearing</li>
                       <li> One-sided head pain, always on the same side of the head</li>
                        <li>Congestion or a runny nose on the same side as the pain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Cluster headache is often considered a type of migraine. Most people who have cluster headaches do not also experience other types of migraines.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h1>Rare Symptoms</h1>
                <br><br><p>Secondary headaches are less common than primary headaches. They can occur as a result of meningitis, brain tumor, concussion, bleeding in the brain, low cerebrospinal fluid pressure, stroke, vascular malformation in the brain, or as a medication side effect.
                        <br>
                    Symptoms of secondary headaches can include:</p>
                    <ul>Severe head pain
                        Vision changes can include blurred vision, double vision, and decreased vision
                        Droopy eyelid
                        Headache symptoms that change substantially with changes in body position
                        Persistent, recurrent vomiting
                        Neck or back stiffness
                        Severe dizziness, vertigo (a sense that the room is spinning), trouble walking
                        Ear pressure or pain
                        Fevers
                        Confusion
                        Loss of appetite
                        Weakness or sensory changes on one side of the face or body
                        You should get medical attention if you experience any symptoms consistent with a secondary headache–the underlying causes can be dangerous to your health and will usually improve with treatment.
                        Complications
                        The most common complications of primary headaches are not due to the headaches themselves, but rather to their treatment. For example, excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) can cause stomach pain and gastrointestinal bleeding.
                        
                        One common complication is a medication-overuse headache (or rebound headache), which can happen if you take painkillers too frequently. This is a serious headache that must be treated by discontinuing the medication cycle. However, for some types of medication, this can lead to withdrawal symptoms, so the process should be managed by a healthcare professional.
                        
                        Rare complications of headaches include:
                        
                        Status migrainosus: The migraine episode lasts for longer than 72 hours without relief. It may require treatment with IV medication.
                        Migrainous infarction: This is when a stroke develops along with a migraine aura.
                        Persistent aura without infarction (PMA): An aura can persist for a week or more.
                        Migraine-associated seizure: A seizure requires different treatments than a migraine.
                        <h1>When to See a Healthcare Provider</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>You should make an appointment to see a healthcare provider if you are experiencing new headaches or worsening headaches or if your headache medicine is no longer effective.
                        
                          You should get urgent medical attention if you have signs of a secondary headache.</li>
                        </p>
                          <h1>  Emergency Attention</h1>
                         You should get emergency medical attention if:
                        
                        
                        
                        <li> You have had a head injury</li>
                        <li> The headache comes on after vigorous physical activity</li>

                        <li> You are having the worse headache of your life</li>

                       <li> You have a fever, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting</li></ul>
                       <h1>A Word From Verywell</h1>
                       <p>If you have headaches, be sure to talk with your healthcare provider. You may be able to get relief and learn how to prevent a recurrence and complications.</p>
